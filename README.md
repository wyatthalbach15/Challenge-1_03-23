# Challenge-1_03-23

## Description
This repository contains the code for the first challenge of the UA Web Development bootcamp. There is a develop and assets folder inside that contain the html and css for the website that was to be altered for the assignment. In the code, I have cleaned up some of the unnecessary CSS, as well as move some items around to make the organization a little cleaner. On the HTML side of things, I altered the names of some components as well as fixed a broken link.
